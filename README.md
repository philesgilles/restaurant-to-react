## Informations:

This project is a modification of my previous work (restaurant-bootstrap)[https://github.com/philesgilles/restaurant-css-framework] to work as a OPA (One Page Application) with React.js

For easy deployment, i've already written dockerfile and docker-compose.yml

The project is deployed using docker-compose on http://163.172.82.216:3001/

## Technologies used:

- NodeJS
- bootstrap
- react
- react-dom
- react-redux
- react-router-dom
- react-script
- react-simple-chatbot
- redux
- styled-components
- tabletop

## Fonctionalities

- Added use of arrow keys to move between images in the gallery.
- Added Online order shop (with cart page): No API, all the logic go trough Redux
- Added Review page fetching informations on google sheet.
- Added Chatbot (still buggy as I didn't spent much time on the logic)
