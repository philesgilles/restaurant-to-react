This project is a modification of my previous work (restaurant-bootstrap)[https://github.com/philesgilles/restaurant-css-framework] to work as a OPA (One Page Application) with React.js

## Technologies:

- NodeJS
- bootstrap
- react
- react-dom
- react-redux
- react-router-dom
- react-script
- react-simple-chatbot
- redux
- styled-components
- tabletop

## Fonctionalities

Added use of arrow keys to move between images in the gallery.
Added Online order shop (with cart page)
Added Review page fetching informations on google sheet
Added Bot 100% Coded in JS. (still buggy as I didn't spent much time on the logic)
