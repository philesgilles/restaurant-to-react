This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It's a modification of previous work (restaurant-bootstrap)[https://github.com/philesgilles/restaurant-css-framework] to work as a one pagge React application.

I have added the possibility to use arrow keys to move between images in the gallery.

The application is already built and can be run very easely using 'serve'package.

### `npm install -g serve`
### `npm serve build`
